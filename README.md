# Speech Recognition Flask App üé§

Welcome to the **Speech Recognition Flask App**! This web application allows users to record their speech, convert it into text, and download both the recognized speech as an MP3 audio file and a .txt file. This project is built using Flask, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), and Python's Speech Recognition library.
